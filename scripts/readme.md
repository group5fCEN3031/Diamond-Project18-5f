# Dump Files
Dump files are used by docker to recreate the database from scratch. They, and the script that uses them, are located in ``/scripts/``. The dump file that controls the content of strapi is **development_db.dump**.

## Creating Dump Files
Creating dump files is down using postgres. When running in the Docker environment, you can open the database in a terminal like so:

Once in the terminal, you can use the ```pg_dump``` command to create the dump file. The full syntax for this is: ```pg_dump -U postgres -f development_db.dump```. This creates the dump file in the current directory. You can then find it in one of two ways: through the Docker UI or through your file navigation system.

### Finding the file through the Docker UI
You can find the file in the 'Files' tab for the database. It's located here:

It will be located in the **docker-entrypoint-initdb.d** folder like so:

You can then right-click and save the file to your desired directory.

Replacing the old dump with this new one will allow you to load your strapi into whatever state it was in when the dump was made.

# Issues
If this does not work, you can alternatively try using the command ```pg_dumpall -U postgres -f dumpall.dump```. This will dump all of the databases and you can then manually remove the ones that you didn't mean to grab.
